  title: Why do we advocate Ruby on Rails technology?
  description: We do love Ruby on Rails because it’s a fast, reliable framework
               that includes everything needed to build complex database-backed
               applications. Rails framework has built-in support for varied
               settings across development, test, and production, and utilizing
               RoR means long-term maintainability and reduced risk of problems
               caused by human error. <b>Technology has powered the web since 2004</b>.
