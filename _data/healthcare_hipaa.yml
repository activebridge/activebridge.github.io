                   sensitive patient health information within the United States. We aimed to create a reliable medical application
                   and a secure HIPAA-compliant cloud hosting environment available 24/7. Additionally, we needed to develop assets
                   for healthcare professionals to manage and resolve prescription orders from mobile devices.
