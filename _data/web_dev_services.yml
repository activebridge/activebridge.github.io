our_approach:
  title: Our web development approach
  description_1: There’s no need to invest in your team of developers - the cheaper
                 option is to collaborate with external teams. Our dedicated teams
                 are agile, and workflow is fully transparent.
  description_2: "We use an Agile methodology that relies on the small steps:
                 releasing versions of a working product regularly and as early
                 as possible. Thus, each iteration is a micro-step in development,
                 immediately validated by practice. It means, you get (albeit small)
                 working functionality directly after the first iteration."
