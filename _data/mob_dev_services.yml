               build a web or a hybrid app, Active Bridge creates projects
               identical to native iOS and Android ones with building components
               and APIs. The result is a mobile UI with all features of the native
               apps.
  all:
  - title: Rapid and cheap mobile app development
    icon: react_native_1.webp
    description: React Native makes it possible to use the same codebase for
                 Android and iOS apps. That’s why <b>React Native development
                 services</b> cost less and allow reducing development time by
                 up to 30% compared to native Android/iOS projects.

                and PlayMarket requirements.
flutter:
  title: Flutter application development
  description_1: Flutter is a mobile app software development kit (SDK) built by
                Google for Android and iOS. It is a <b>cross-platform app
                development tool</b>. Businesses use Flutter to fill the gap
                between quality and productivity and to build apps for iOS and
                Android without extra costs. It is one of the newest cross-platform
                technologies our development team prefers to use.
  description_2: What’s unique about Flutter, it makes it possible to build apps
                 that look and work like native ones but without native components.
  all:
  - title: An app has the potential for further growth
    icon: flutter_1.webp
    description: Experienced <b>Flutter developers</b> design apps that will not
                 only work on mobile devices but also on web browsers and desktops.
                 That’s possible thanks to a single codebase.
  - title: Fast coding and perfect UX
    icon: flutter_2.webp
    description: Flutter is built based on the principles of <b>modern development
                 practices</b>. It means developers create mobile applications
                 with <b>reach UI elements</b> in only several lines of code.
                 The Flutter includes two ranges of widgets corresponding to
                 Google’s design language (Material Design widgets) and Apple’s
                 iOS design language.
  - title: Better Native Performance
    icon: flutter_3.webp
    description: Flutter helps to rephrase the content to UI manually and can
                 update factors in the state. So mobile developers can skip various
                 needless actions to build <b>swift and flawless UI</b>. Also,
                 Fluter makes the testing process <b>quicker and more efficient</b>.
                 Engineers use a single test for both platforms.

    description: A client approaches us with an idea for a mobile app. We request
                 a Terms of Reference (ToR), and if the customer doesn’t have
                 one, we send a brief for developing a mobile app. The brief helps
                 to prioritize the app’s goals and objectives. If required, we
                 sign an NDA.
