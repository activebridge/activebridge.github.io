flutter:
  title: Flutter application development
  description_1: Flutter, developed by Google, is a powerful software development kit (SDK) for creating high-quality,
                <b>cross-platform applications</b> for Android and iOS. Businesses leverage Flutter to balance quality and
                productivity, building feature-rich applications without incurring additional costs. As one of the most
                innovative cross-platform technologies, Flutter is a preferred choice for our development team.
  description_2: What’s unique about Flutter, it makes it possible to build apps
                 that look and work like native ones but without native components.
  all:
  - title: An app has the potential for further growth
    icon: flutter_1.webp
    description: Experienced <b>Flutter developers</b> design apps that will not
                 only work on mobile devices but also on web browsers and desktops.
                 That’s possible thanks to a single codebase.
  - title: Fast coding and perfect UX
    icon: flutter_2.webp
    description: Flutter is built based on the principles of <b>modern development
                 practices</b>. It means developers create mobile applications
                 with <b>rich UI elements</b> in only several lines of code.
                 The Flutter includes two ranges of widgets corresponding to
                 Google’s design language (Material Design widgets) and Apple’s
                 iOS design language.
  - title: Better Native Performance
    icon: flutter_3.webp
    description: Flutter helps to rephrase the content to UI manually and can
                 update factors in the state. So mobile developers can skip various
                 needless actions to build <b>swift and flawless UI</b>. Also,
                 Flutter makes the testing process <b>quicker and more efficient</b>.
                 Engineers use a single test for both platforms.
ionic:
  title: Ionic <br> application development
  description: Ionic is an open-source framework used for <b>hybrid mobile app
              development. Hybrid apps</b> refer to mini websites operating
              within a mobile app and possessing direct access to the primary
              levels of the server. Focus on technology innovation nature, our
              team of <b>Ionic developers</b> leverages Ionic navigation tools,
              Ionic features, and Cordova plugins to develop <b>feature-rich

  - title: Discovery stage.
    icon: approach_1.webp
    description: The process begins when a client presents an idea for a mobile app. We request a Terms of Reference (ToR),
                 or if unavailable, provide a brief to outline the app’s goals and objectives. This ensures a clear
                 understanding of project priorities. If necessary, we sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to protect
                 client confidentiality.
  - title: Estimation stage

    description: "We provide two types of estimates based on project complexity. Quick Estimation: Completed within hours
                 or a day, offering a general overview of labor requirements. Detailed Estimation: Takes several days
                 to a week, delivering a precise breakdown of tasks and expected outcomes."

    description: Some clients come with an out-of-the-box design. If the customer
                 does not have a design, we generate the UI/UX from scratch. At
                 this stage, the UI/UX designer provides static prototypes and,
                 at the clients request, interactive application prototypes.
