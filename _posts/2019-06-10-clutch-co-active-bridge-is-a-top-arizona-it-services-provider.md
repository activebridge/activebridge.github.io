Clutch is a B2B ratings and reviews platform located in Washington, DC. In their latest **report** that we were named in, their dedicated analyst evaluated B2B companies across the United States based on their ability to deliver high-quality work to their clients, their attentive customer service, and their impressive portfolios of diverse projects and clientele. 

> For three years we have been cooperating with Clutch marketplace. Our company appreciates this cooperation it yields fruits, [CEO Alex Galushka](/about/team) said. Thanks to Clutch managers' advice and company maintenance, Active Bridge has gained popular Clutch awards.  For us to be featured as a leader on Clutch means to get an expert review of business professionals. It inspires and makes us achieve new goals. Thank you Clutch team. 

Clutch’s review process is thorough and transparent, and we’re appreciative of our clients for taking the time to leave a review. As a result, we’ve been able to maintain a nearly perfect **4.7-star rating**, as well as continue to be recognized by Clutch.

Beyond the generous reviews left on Clutch, our success also extends to the company’s sister-sites: Visual Objects and The Manifest. Visual Objects is a platform that a potential client may use to view the **[portfolio of work](https://visualobjects.com/profile/active-bridge)** from an agency or service provider, so that they can visualize a future project. The Manifest also helps prospective clients, but through sharing industry reports and how-to guides that provide businesses with practical knowledge. Here, we are **[ listed](https://themanifest.com/web-development/shopify/companies#activebridge)**  with other top developers.

Again, it is truly an honor to be recognized by Clutch for our work among **IT staff augmentation firms**. We are looking forward to the future, as we continue combining our clients’ ideas and our team’s talents to create great results.
