Let’s deep into the term of “full-stack” and consider how our team interprets the [job functions](https://active-bridge.com/services) of our full-stack engineers. 

## Full-Stack Web Development

### Network. Server. Hosting.

Here we consider what can be broken and why. The full-stack developer has to understand appropriate using of a file system, cloud hosting, web-based resources and data redundancy. The next point of knowledge is application zooming taking into account the hardware limitations. The full-stack engineer has to detect the things that can happen in real world, but computer diagnostic doesn’t show them. The full-stack programmer has ability work hand-to-hand with DevOps.

### Business logic. Data modeling. Database.

The full-stack engineer knows how to build the balanced relation-based data model with foreign keywords, indexes, views. The full-stack developer is familiar with NoSQL and knows when the decision is right according to the relation-based data base. If the data model is irrelevant, business logic will need the extra code to reduce all gaps. In addition, the full-stack web developer should have hard object-oriented skills and work experience with different frameworks.  

### MVC. AMP. API.

The full-stack web developer understands that the outside world can act against the business logic and data model. The framework should be used increasingly at this level. The full-stack developers have the ability to write clear, consistent, simple interface.   

### User interface. User experience.

**What else…**
