## Introduction: Ruby on Rails in 2025 – Still Standing Strong?

Ruby on Rails has been part of the web development conversation for over two decades. It launched startups, scaled enterprise platforms, and powered some of the internet’s most recognizable products. But in a landscape shaped by new frameworks, AI tools, and shifting priorities, many tech teams are asking the same question: Is Rails still a smart choice in 2025?

At Active Bridge, we’ve been building Ruby on Rails applications for more than a decade. It has changed from a quick prototyping tool into a strong, scalable framework. Now it still helps create [real-world products in many industries](https://activebridge.org/solutions/).

In this article, we’ll walk through what’s new in Rails 8 and Ruby 3, highlight ecosystem changes, and compare Rails to modern alternatives like Node.js, Django, and Elixir. Along the way, we’ll share what this means for teams deciding how and what to build next.

Whether you scale a platform or start a new one, here’s what we observe in Rails today and where it’s heading.

## The Big Picture: What’s Driving Change in Software Development?

In recent years, [building software has become more complex](https://activebridge.org/blog/how-emerging-tech-is-reshaping-custom-software-development). Teams must ship faster, maintain security, and keep costs under control all at the same time. New tools and workflows have emerged to support this shift. At the center of it all is a growing push toward cloud-native development, AI-assisted workflows, and platform consolidation.

![`Macro trends in software development 2025`](https://i.imgur.com/g40zRnQ.png)

According to [Google Cloud’s 2024 report](https://cloud.google.com/resources/data-ai-trends-report-2024), most enterprise workloads now run in cloud-native environments. AI tools are increasingly integrated into development workflows for building end-user features, but also for writing, testing, and shipping code. Many teams use coding assistants, automated scanners, and observability tools as part of their daily work. 

This evolution influences how teams choose their stack. Rails has kept pace by focusing on developer experience and process integration. It works well with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions. It also supports modern delivery methods through its testing culture and built-in rules. These qualities help teams stay consistent across environments and phases of the release cycle.

Security is another growing concern. [Red Hat's Kubernetes Adoption report](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/state-kubernetes-security-report-2024) shows that over two-thirds of companies have postponed releases. This is because of security issues. With Rails, many risks can be mitigated early by automating dependency checks and embedding security into the CI/CD pipeline.

Platform engineering is also changing how teams organize their tools. Forrester predicts that nearly half of enterprise teams are moving toward unified platforms. In this setup, Rails projects benefit from consistent structure and compatibility with common DevOps tooling. Teams using GitHub, GitLab, or CircleCI can manage everything from version control to deployments within a single environment.

The way we build software continues to evolve, but the requirements remain familiar: stability, speed, security, and collaboration. Rails still supports those needs and remains part of the conversation for teams working toward long-term success.

## Rails 8 & Ruby 3.3: Performance Gains and Developer Productivity in 2025

Rails has always prioritized developer experience, but recent versions show how much attention is also going into performance and infrastructure simplicity. The newest updates in Rails 8.0.1 and Ruby 3.3 reflect that focus, helping teams build faster, with fewer moving parts.

Rails 8.0.1 brings a mix of polish and practical improvements. Solid Queue, now part of Rails by default, handles background jobs without needing Redis or third-party services. For many teams, this reduces setup time and cuts operational complexity. Other changes, such as better template rendering and support for custom class attributes, make work easier at scale. They do this without needing major rewrites.

Ruby 3.3 contributes speed gains of its own. The updated YJIT compiler reduces warm-up time, while the new RJIT and Prism parser improve support for static analysis, better tooling, and smoother debugging. In benchmarks shared by indie devs, Rails apps using Ruby 3.3 with YJIT showed response time gains of around 12% compared to Ruby 3.2.

The impact of these updates goes beyond benchmarks. Rails apps now boot faster, respond quicker, and require less tuning to run well. That’s especially valuable for teams who care about stability and want to avoid overengineering early on.

Developers have also shifted how they deploy Rails apps. More teams are using tools like Kamal instead of relying on PaaS platforms like Heroku. It simplifies hosting across VPS or bare-metal servers and gives teams full control over how apps are shipped. At 37signals, for example, the move off managed cloud services saved $7 million over five years, with no loss in performance and fewer moving parts.

Rails also remains one of the most actively maintained open-source frameworks. In the past year alone, the Rails repo saw over 6,500 commits and 1,500 issues closed. Ruby’s core team contributed more than 5,000 commits, helping ensure the language stays modern, efficient, and developer-friendly.

These updates make Rails and Ruby faster, simpler, and easier to maintain. Teams don’t need to choose between speed and simplicity. The result is a framework that works better and fits how developers create and manage software in 2025.

## The Ecosystem in 2025: Tools, Testing & Dev Experience

The improvements in Rails and Ruby aren’t just about core updates. The surrounding ecosystem continues to shape how teams work. In 2025, Rails offers a well-supported, developer-friendly toolkit that covers frontends, testing, deployment, and automation. This matters when the goal is to build reliable products without extra overhead.

For interactive interfaces, we often use Hotwire, Turbo, and Stimulus. These tools allow teams to build dynamic UI features using Rails conventions, without introducing a separate frontend stack. They’re well-maintained by the Rails core team and widely used in production environments. Turbo, for instance, has over 9,000 stars on GitHub and supports a clean, responsive user experience across many SaaS platforms.

On the deployment side, flexibility continues to improve. We have used Kamal to send updates without any downtime. It gives developers full control over their SW infrastructure, especially on VPS and bare-metal servers. For clients who want managed hosting, services like Fly.io and Render provide easy-to-use Rails options. These services simplify setup and make scaling easier.

Testing remains one of Rails’ strongest areas. We use RSpec, RuboCop, and Brakeman in our CI/CD pipelines. These tools catch regressions early, enforce consistency, and support healthy long-term codebases. Many of our developers use GitHub Copilot to speed up test scaffolding and repetitive code. It is not a replacement for reviews, but a tool to help with daily tasks.

The ecosystem also supports a better structure. Libraries like view_component, with 5.2K GitHub stars, help manage frontend complexity without stepping outside Rails. Stimulus Rails lets developers enhance specific UI elements with JavaScript while keeping things lightweight and maintainable.

![`The Rails stack in 2025: A modern ecosystem overview`](https://i.imgur.com/0R1t57e.png)

We see these tools in use across client projects and community conversations. Tech people discuss them on Dev.to, share them at meetups, and consistently improve them through open-source feedback. What stands out is the ecosystem’s steady evolution, refining what works.

## Talent Landscape: Can You Still Hire Ruby on Rails Developers in 2025?

The strength of a framework depends on both how well it works and whether you can find people who know how to use it. Rails continues to be a skill that companies hire for across industries and regions. The steady demand shows how widely the framework remains in use in production.

![`Ruby on Rails developer job market in 2025`](https://i.imgur.com/rKZ9Rqf.png)

As of early 2025, there are more than 9,000 active job listings for Ruby on Rails roles globally. Over 3,700 of those are based in the U.S., followed by India (~900), Canada (~530), and the UK (~300). New openings appear regularly on platforms like LinkedIn and Hacker News, showing that Rails remains in active use across startups, digital agencies, and internal product teams.

Most openings are full-time roles. Around 90% of listings are for permanent positions, and roughly 45% support remote or hybrid setups. In North America, full-time on-site roles are still common, especially at companies preferring local teams. But in the UK, Canada, and parts of Asia, remote-first is more widely adopted. This flexibility has made it easier for distributed teams to hire experienced RoR developers and for developers to work across borders.

Mid and senior-level developers are in highest demand. Around 55–60% of current openings target engineers with several years of experience. Junior roles are still present. Around a third of all Rails jobs are open to early-career developers. The U.S. market, in particular, shows a relatively balanced distribution, with entry-level jobs appearing alongside senior ones. In India and other offshore-heavy regions, job ads tend to skew more senior.

Compensation varies widely by location. In the U.S., mid-level Rails developers often earn $100K–$120K annually, with senior roles reaching higher. Entry-level roles typically start between $75K–$90K. In the UK, salaries range from £40K–£60K, and in continental Europe from €50K–€70K. Developers in Asia-Pacific regions working remotely with U.S. or EU clients often command higher-than-local averages.

Community health supports all of this. The main Rails GitHub repository has over 56,000 stars and more than 21,800 forks. Over 5,000 contributors have worked on the codebase, and pull request activity remains steady. The RailsConf 2025 agenda includes a mix of talks from core contributors, consulting teams, and solo developers, showing that the framework is still evolving with input from across the community. Meetup groups, GitHub discussions, and regional conferences all continue to support the flow of new ideas and collaboration.

![`Rails ecosystem: GitHub Activity Snapshot (2024 – 2025)`](https://i.imgur.com/tQxDd7f.png)

From our experience at Active Bridge, hiring Rails developers today is very possible, especially if you’re open to remote-first or distributed setups. Most of the talent is already familiar with Rails workflows, and many have experience supporting long-lived production code. The key is knowing what level you’re hiring for, and which regions make the most sense for your team or clients. Rails may not be the trendiest framework on paper, but it’s a safe and practical choice when it comes to building real-world development teams.

## Can Ruby on Rails Scale? How It Handles Modern Architectures?

Hiring the right team is only part of the equation. For many companies, the bigger question is whether Rails can handle modern application demands, especially at scale. In 2025, the answer depends less on abstract benchmarks and more on how you design your system. Rails gives you the tools, but like any framework, it still requires thoughtful decisions.

Companies like Shopify, GitHub, Basecamp, and Hey.com have scaled Rails in production. All of them serve large user bases with heavy data flows. Their success doesn’t rely on a single technique. It comes from how Rails fits into systems designed for observability, performance, and clear separation of responsibilities.

ActiveRecord remains at the core of Rails data handling. It has gained better support for efficient queries, async handling, and multi-DB workloads in recent versions. Teams using ActiveRecord in large systems often rely on scopes, custom SQL layers, and connection pooling strategies to keep things predictable under load.

Caching has also become easier to manage in modern Rails setups. Tools like redis-cache-store, fragment caching, and HTTP cache control are well-supported. Profiling tools like rack-mini-profiler and Scout APM help identify and fix bottlenecks early, before they affect end users.

For systems built with multiple services, Rails doesn’t get in the way. It works well as a central layer for frontend delivery, background processing, or API integration. We have worked on Rails projects that connect easily with GraphQL, REST APIs, JSON:API endpoints, and gRPC services. We did this without needing a lot of customization.

Ruby on Rails framework is also cloud-ready. Deployment tools like Kamal and platform setups using Docker or Kubernetes allow teams to scale horizontally without locking into one provider. In many of our recent projects, Rails apps run in containerized environments with managed Postgres, job queues, and autoscaling – sometimes in full cloud-native setups, other times as part of hybrid deployments that mix cloud and edge workloads.

Scalability isn’t automatic, and Rails doesn’t pretend it is. But for teams that know what they need, Rails holds up well under pressure. Most of the scaling stories we've seen or supported don’t depend on rewriting the stack. They depend on how well the team understands the layers around it.

## Ruby on Rails vs. Node.js, Django, Laravel & Elixir in 2025

For teams choosing a framework in 2025, the comparison usually is about long-term trade-offs: developer experience, hiring availability, scalability, and how well a framework fits their product goals.

Rails vs. Node.js often comes down to structure versus flexibility. Node gives teams more freedom to choose how they handle routing, middleware, and database access. That’s useful in some cases, but it also means spending more time setting up conventions and reviewing code consistency. Rails has strong defaults and encourages shared practices. For teams with multiple contributors, this reduces friction. It’s also easier to bring new developers into a Rails project because the structure is predictable.

Rails vs. Django is closer. Both frameworks are mature, batteries-included, and heavily used in production. The difference tends to show up in tooling and ecosystem depth. Rails developers benefit from a tighter integration between frontend and backend, especially when using Hotwire or Turbo. Django projects often use separate frontend stacks and have a stronger presence in scientific or academic applications. In web-focused product development, Rails usually offers a faster path to a working app.

Rails vs. Laravel matters more if you’re already working with PHP. Laravel’s documentation is excellent, and it has polished tooling around things like admin panels and e-commerce setups. But its job market is more fragmented, and PHP as a language doesn’t have the same momentum in newer SaaS or platform work. Rails is often used in startups and custom app development. The community usually focuses on teams creating long-term, maintainable software.

Rails vs. Phoenix (Elixir) is a conversation about concurrency and scalability. Phoenix shines in real-time systems: chat, trading platforms, live dashboards. Its lightweight processes and functional core make it efficient under load. But it comes with a smaller ecosystem and fewer senior developers available. Rails can scale, but it tends to rely more on background jobs, caching, and horizontal scaling techniques. That’s not worse, it's just a different model. If your team is optimizing for rapid product development with occasional scale spikes, Rails will likely be easier to manage.

Hiring remains a practical concern. Node and Python have larger developer pools, but experience levels vary. Ruby’s job market is smaller but more stable. [According to 2025 job board data](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/12/10/indeed-2025-us-jobs-and-hiring-trends-report/), over 9,000 active Rails roles are listed globally, with demand focused on mid-to-senior level developers. We’ve seen teams struggle more with hiring Elixir engineers or finding experienced Laravel developers for complex systems. Rails sits in the middle: not the largest pool, but often more consistent in experience and expectations.

![`Ruby on Rails VS Modern Frameworks: 2025 Comparison`](https://i.imgur.com/2xobgbD.png)

Most of the teams we work with focus on building something reliable, maintainable, and scalable. Rails continues to support that mindset. When paired with clean architecture and strong CI/CD practices, it gives teams a proven foundation that grows with them. They build without locking them into overcomplicated setups.

## Real-World Use Cases: Who’s Still Building with Rails in 2025?

Rails still runs in production across many industries because it works well for real product teams solving complex problems. We continue to see it used in places where reliability, maintainability, and speed-to-value matter.

Major platforms like Shopify and GitHub still rely on Rails in production. Shopify handles global traffic and high transaction volumes with a modular Rails core, layered services, and performance tuning. GitHub has layered in other languages, but Rails still powers major parts of the application. They’ve been open about how they’ve scaled their monolith and upgraded across multiple Rails versions while staying productive.

Rails also powers more focused, high-stakes systems like HEY.com and Basecamp. Both are built and maintained by the creators of Rails. These products use the framework and help to shape its direction. What they show is that a well-structured Rails application can support long-term stability without slowing down product work.

In our work at Active Bridge, we’ve seen [Rails perform well in a range of domains](https://activebridge.org/solutions/). It’s a good fit for SaaS platforms, marketplaces, internal business tools, and healthcare systems. It works well especially when the product needs to evolve quickly but remain stable in the long term.

![`Rails in action: Domains where it works well`](https://i.imgur.com/IsIFUnS.png)

We support an [eBilling platform for a U.S. healthcare company](https://activebridge.org/solutions/insurtech-case). Rails manages complex billing tasks, custom reports, and links to outside compliance systems. The system is mission-critical, but also under constant improvement. A stable core and test coverage help the team ship changes without regressions.

In a [data center marketplace](https://activebridge.org/solutions/marketplace-case), Rails powers the backend for vendor management, pricing filters, CRM features, and customer support tools. We’ve helped scale the platform without major rewrites, adding caching, Sidekiq-based job queues, and request-level monitoring to keep it efficient.

We’ve also used Rails for B2C [eCommerce platforms](https://activebridge.org/solutions/ecommerce-case). In a recent sustainable fashion project, we created product pages driven by influencers. We also linked vendor inventory to logistics and payment systems. All of this was done in one Rails-based application. With clear structure and fast iteration, we were able to move from MVP to production without needing multiple stacks or heavy integrations.

These projects have different goals, but they all share the same priorities: reliability, adaptability, and strong development workflows. Rails does what it does best. It supports business logic and works well with APIs and background workers. It also provides a good experience for developers, making long-term maintenance easier.

## Is Ruby on Rails Still a Good Choice in 2025?

Rails doesn’t suit every use case, but many teams building real products still find it a smart, future-ready option. Its strengths are obvious. It has a solid structure. The development cycle is fast. There is strong support from the community. It also has a well-developed ecosystem that simplifies tasks.

![`Where Rails still fits best (in 2025)`](https://i.imgur.com/fVVF0GM.png)

**For startups**, Rails is often the right balance of speed and stability. It’s great for MVPs that need to reach the market fast. You don’t have to redo key features like authentication, background jobs, admin tools, or API endpoints. With so much built-in, teams can focus on logic and iteration.

**For SaaS companies**, the appeal is in stability and maintainability. Rails makes it easier to support large codebases over time, especially when the team changes or grows. Features like strong testing frameworks, sensible defaults, and scalable patterns help teams ship updates without introducing regressions. Hiring is manageable. The pool of candidates is not very large, but experienced Rails developers have good habits. They often excel in architecture, testing, and communication.

**For enterprise teams**, Rails is a good choice for internal apps, client dashboards, and backend systems. These systems need clear ownership and support. In our work, we’ve seen it used effectively for revenue cycle management, supply chain coordination, and service marketplaces. Projects that demand long-term support cycles and minimal need for rebuilds. The ability to extend functionality through service integration or modular architecture makes it easier to connect Rails apps with other systems.

Whether or not to choose Rails depends on your priorities. If you want full control over performance tuning or you’re building a system where every millisecond counts, there may be lighter or more specialized options. But if your goal is to build a solid product, with a framework that handles common challenges well and doesn’t slow your team down, Rails still deserves serious consideration.

## Final Thoughts: What the Future Holds

Frameworks come and go. But some stay because they keep evolving in the right ways. Rails has never aimed to be trendy. It's aimed to be useful. In 2025, that’s still its strongest feature.

It may not show up in every “hot tools” list, but it continues to power products that serve millions of users. It helps small teams ship faster. It gives larger teams a structure that holds up over time. It does this with a strong ecosystem, active maintainers, and a global community. This community builds, documents, and contributes every day.

At Active Bridge, we have worked with Rails for over ten years. We build new products, scale existing ones, and support long-running systems in various industries. We choose it because it makes sense for the kind of work we do and the outcomes our clients care about.

If you want to move your product forward or see if Rails is still a good fit, we’re here to talk. We’ve seen what Rails can do, and we’d be glad to share what we’ve learned.
