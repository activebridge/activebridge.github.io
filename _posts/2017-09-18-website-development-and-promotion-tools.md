Your website is like a kid, you raise it, take care of it,  worry about it, and give only useful and fresh products. Today, agenda is a choosing of such useful, fresh, interesting tools with Active Bridge for your webresource. This article is devoted to  those who are looking for effective ways to attract the audience and create a brand. Correct product promotion is always a whole complex of the most diverse activities. So I’ve tried to show services and resources that affect different aspects, from the quality checker, content selling to the analysis of results.

Let’s start

## Part I. Analyze the data

#### [Keywords Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keywords-everywhere-keywo/hbapdpeemoojbophdfndmlgdhppljgmp)

Keywords Everywhere is the extension for Firefox and Chrome. It provides information about traffic, competitiveness, and cost per click for any keyword that you enter into the search bar. Also, you can highlight word variation included into range of selection. You can save and upload them. The service works with Google.com, Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Trends, Google Search, UberSuggest, AnswerThePublic.com, Soovle.com, KeywordShitter.com.

#### [Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/)

Fullstory collects information about the users’ behavior on the site (clicks, text input, page transitions) and conducts an analysis.  You can draw conclusions about the trends by means this analysis. There is the ability to view reports according to specific users, search for an action, or click to display statistics for any object on the page. In addition to analytics, step-by-step logs will also be useful for technical support.

#### [Grade My Ads](http://grademyads.com/)

Grade My Ads is a quick way to learn the full information about the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns on Facebook. The program summarizes the data about money, the audience, the cost of involving the user and displays them in the form of brief, easy-to-visual reports. Where you will find a general assessment of the campaign effectiveness as a  one-point scale.

#### [Canny](https://canny.io/)

Canny is a platform for collecting the most detailed feedback and suggestions. Users are given the opportunity to vote or to offer their ideas and express their views. Developers can give feedback, implementing those corrections and innovations that were noticed by users and have relevant statuses. In this way, there is a conversation useful for both sides: on the one hand, the team receives significant information about the audience expectations; users see a reaction to their comments.

## Part II. Content

#### [PinGo](http://ping-go.com/)

PinGo is a useful simulator for start-ups, that have not had enough time to write quality press releases. The interactive tool works with you, asking typical "journalistic" questions to gather the necessary information, and then compiling a draft version of the press release according to your answers. It helps to understand how to select information and what the text structure should be. Although we would probably not recommend using such a semi-finished automatic assembly for distribution. PingGo offers tools for drawing up a database of journalists in your sector that you should contact.


#### [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

Hemingway, perhaps, is not for everyone, but its conciseness and capacity is something that definitely lacks for many sites and press releases. A tool with a spoken name Hemingway Editor 3.0 uses algorithms built according to the rules of classic text analyze. Hemingway points inaccurate sentences or collocation, offering alternatives and giving an overall assessment of readability. These tips help make the text more concise, informative and easy to understand.

#### [StockSnap](https://stocksnap.io/)

StockSnap is searching for quality and relevant photos to upload on your site or blog.  All photos on StockSnap fall under the Creative Commons CC0 license. That means you can copy, change, distribute any photo on the site, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. Developers describe it as: "like Google Images, only for licensed photos."

## Part III. Branding

#### [Viable.com](https://domainnamesales.com)

The Viable application checks the name you have planned for your project and if it is used by other products or companies. The developers call such resources as Domainr, Markify, App Store, Product Hunt, Angel List, and Pearson, that were used to build the app.

#### [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com)

Piktochart is an easy-to-use infographic maker. Also, you can see product presentations from companies that later became big players in their sectors. It is a good source of ideas, inspiration, and thoughts about the recipe for success.

Also, there are programs for the PC. Personally, I almost do not use them because most of them have online the analogs. Some of them are more convenient, and other can be combined with several services at once.
